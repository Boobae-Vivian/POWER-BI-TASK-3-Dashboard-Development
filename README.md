# DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT

## INTRODUCTION

A dashboard is a summary of important information presented in one place through key metrics and visuals. In Power BI, users can combine various visuals like charts, tables, and KPIs on a single canvas. This allows them to customize and arrange visuals for a focused view of relevant data, making monitoring and decision-making easier. Dashboards are interactive, letting users drill down into details or apply filters for deeper analysis.

In the banking world, the demand for insightful data analysis is crucial. To meet this need, we're developing a tracking dashboard for a bank using the 'Bank Term Deposit Subscription' dataset. This dynamic dashboard aims to provide actionable insights by highlighting two essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): total balance and total campaign. We'll analyze campaign counts by marital status, track monthly changes in total balance, examine campaign performance based on education, and explore shifts in total balance across different job categories. To simplify user experience, we'll add a month slicer feature, making it easy for users to choose specific months. This user-friendly tool will offer the bank a clear view of its performance, helping in better decision-making.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

1. Create two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Total balance
   - Total campaign
2. Analyze campaign count based on marital status
3. Categorize total balance by month
4. Segment total campaign by education
5. Segment total balance by job
6. Incorporate a month slicer feature into the dashboard

## SKILLS AND CONCEPTS TO BE DEMONSTRATED

Developing a tracking dashboard for a bank, utilizing the 'Bank Term Deposit Subscription' dataset involves a combination of technical skills, data analysis, and non-technical skills. Here are the skills and concepts to be demonstrated in this task:

1. Dashboard Design and Development:
   - Skills: Proficiency in using dashboard development tools (e.g. Power BI) to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
   - Concepts: Principles of effective dashboard design, including layout, color choice, and user interaction.
2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Skills: Creating and implementing KPIs such as total balance and total campaign.
   - Concepts: Understanding of key metrics relevant to the banking domain.
3. Data Analysis and Segmentation:
   - Skills: Analyzing campaign counts and total balances based on different parameters (marital status, month, education, job).
   - Concepts: Segmentation techniques and their application in financial data analysis.
4. Month Slicer Feature:
   - Skills: Implementing interactive features like a month slicer for user-controlled data exploration.
   - Concepts: Enhancing user experience through interactive elements in data visualization.
5. Communication Skills:
   - Skills: Clearly articulating the objectives, methods, and outcomes of the task.
   - Concepts: Effective communication of complex technical information to non-technical stakeholders.
6. Problem-solving:
   - Skills: Identifying challenges in data analysis and dashboard development and proposing effective solutions.
   - Concepts: Critical thinking and problem-solving in the context of data analysis.

By effectively combining these skills and concepts, the task aims to create a comprehensive and functional tracking dashboard that addresses the specific needs of a bank using the provided dataset.

## STEPS ON HOW TO DEVELOPE THE 'BANK TERM DEPOSIT SUBSRIPTION' DASHBOARD

- Bring in the 'Bank Term Deposit Subscription' dataset into power bi desktop following due steps already documented in my work "power bi task 1: data integration" [Click Here to view](https://github.com/Boobae-Vivian/POWER-BI-TASK-1-Dataset-Integration)
- The imported dataset is an already cleaned dataset and has no need for data cleaning and transformation but i have a work on data cleaning and transformation [Click To View](
